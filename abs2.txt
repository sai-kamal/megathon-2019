Dynamic programming is a powerful method for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, it does not always work well, particularly for some NP-hard problems
having extremely large state spaces. In this paper, we propose an approach to boost the
capability of dynamic programming with neural networks. First, we replace the conventional tabular method with neural networks of polynomial sizes to approximately represent
dynamic programming functions. And then we design an iterative algorithm to train the
neural network with data generated from a solution reconstruction process. Our method
combines the approximating ability and flexibility of neural networks and the advantage
of dynamic programming in utilizing intrinsic properties of a problem. This approach can
significantly reduce the space complexity and it is flexible in balancing space, running time,
and accuracy. We apply the method to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The experimental results show that our approach can solve larger problems that are intractable for
conventional dynamic programming and the performances are near optimal, outperforming
the well-known approximation algorithms
