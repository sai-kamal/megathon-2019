With the increasing number of scientic publications, research
paper recommendation has become increasingly important for scientists. Most researchers rely on keyword-based search or following
citations in other papers, in order to nd relevant research articles.
And usually they spend a lot of time without getting satisfactory
results. This study aims to propose a personalized research paper
recommendation system, that facilitate this task by recommending
papers based on usersâ€™ explicit and implicit feedback. The users will
be allowed to explicitly specify the papers of interest. In addition,
user activities (e.g., viewing abstracts or full-texts) will be analyzed
in order to enhance usersâ€™ proles. Most of the current research
paper recommendation and information retrieval systems use the
classical bag-of-words methods, which donâ€™t consider the context
of the words and the semantic similarity between the articles. This
study will use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to discover continuous and latent semantic features of the papers, in order to
improve the recommendation quality. The proposed approach utilizes PubMed so far, since it is frequently used by physicians and
scientists, but it can easily incorporate other datasets in the future.
